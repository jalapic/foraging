It's the list of the randomized timepoint for eating and drinking that I went back to collect duration for that mouse, and that behavior, on that timepoint.

"durationdata.RDS" - the basic list
"durationdata_recodingdata.RDS" #extract chrt36 and chrt83 from this list and replace ones from the basic list
"durationdata_recodingdata_2.RDS" #only extract chrt 46
"durationdata_recodingdata_3.RDS" #only extract chrt 69 (this is the real deal)
